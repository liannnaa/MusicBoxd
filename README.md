# MusicBoxd

"MusicBoxd": A comprehensive social media app designed for music lovers. This platform provides an avenue for users to share, rate, and review music albums in a similar fashion to how Letterboxd operates for films. The web application is built using React.js for a fluid user interface, Node.js and Express.js for efficient back-end processing, and JavaScript to enable dynamic content.

Functionality includes the ability for users to create and customize their profiles, follow other music enthusiasts, connect with friends, and engage in discussions about various albums. Users can also form playlists, compile their favourite albums, and share their personal reviews and ratings on a public forum.

In addition, the application aggregates reviews from other platforms and music critics, providing users with a wide range of perspectives. The integration with mainstream social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram allows for easy sharing of users' musical taste, reviews, and ratings, increasing the overall reach and impact of their posts. The application emphasizes the aspect of social sharing and community building, turning the solitary act of music listening into a communal experience.
